# rock-paper-scissors

In this project, I apply the knowledge that I have gained this
far in The Odin Project.

What I learned:
-   In order for a function to work, it has to be called, JS
    won't just execute a function because it is written. It
    can be called by simply writing the function name along
    with the arguments directly below the function.
-   I can put console.log(x) before the return value of an if 
    statement, allowing me to see what my output will be, while
    also updating the necessary value.
-   It is important to get the scope of what you are working on
    correct, otherwise it will cause a lot of confusion. For me,
    the round counter was particularly confusing at first because
    I didn't set the proper scope, and so it initially did not get
    properly updated.
